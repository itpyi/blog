Cleaning lemma is an important property of stabilizer quantum codes.
It states that for any region supporting no logical operators, a logical operator passing through this region can be cleaned outside the region.
Conventional proofs of this lemma is based on dimension counting.
In this note, we prove a stronger lemma, revealing a more fundamental algebraic structure behind the cleaning lemma.
