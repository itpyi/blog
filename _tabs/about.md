本站主要包括如下几类内容：

- 学术随笔（Scholarly Notes）：梳理某一领域的发展历史、某一问题的前沿进展，或表达对一些学术问题的个人理解。包含较多技术细节的一般提供 PDF 版本，网页只是作为简介和导引。这类内容预设的读者是作者本人（例如梳理文献以备查找）、学界同行以及任何对严肃的学术研究感兴趣的人。
- 科普：力求用简明、生动的语言介绍人类已经理解得比较清楚的事物。
- 技术笔记：在与计算机、自行车、相机或其他家用器械打交道时遇到的问题和解决办法。有时会提供一些较为系统的介绍。
- 文艺评论：对音乐、文学、绘画、电影等文艺作品或思潮的评论。
- 读书笔记：读书时偶然或系统的收获。所读书目是学术著作，但并非物理、数学、计算机领域因此我不能给出较为全面、专业的见解的，也归于此类而非「学术随笔」。
- 个人随笔：更个人化的随笔和记录。

本站语言以汉语为主，目前偶有以英语创作的文章。分类和标签中，与学术关系较密切的提供英语翻译。本站一般使用简体字，以其对小字屏幕阅读相对友好故。本站欢迎使用任何语言、文字的朋友访问交流，浏览器一键翻译的功能可以在很大程度上消除语言的障碍。

## English Version

This site primarily includes the following categories of content:

- Scholarly Notes: These summarize the history of a field, explore cutting-edge research on a particular topic, or express personal understanding of academic issues. Works containing significant technical detail are generally available in PDF format, with web pages serving only as introductions and guides. The intended audience for this type of content is the author himself (for example, reviewing the literature for future reference), academic colleagues, and anyone interested in serious academic research.

- Popular Science: These strive to use concise and engaging language to explain topics that are already relatively well understood.

- Technical Notes: These describe problems and solutions encountered when working with computers, bicycles, cameras, or other household appliances. More systematic introductions may also be provided.

- Literary and Art Criticism: These discuss literary and art works or currents, such as music, literature, painting, and film.

- Reading Notes: These are occasional or systematic observations from reading. Readings that are academic, but not in physics, mathematics, or computers, and therefore lack comprehensive, professional insights, fall into this category rather than "Scholarly Notes."

- Personal Notes: These are more personal notes and records.

This site is primarily written in Chinese, with occasional articles in English. Categories and tags related to academic topics are provided with English translations. This site generally uses simplified Chinese characters, which are easier to read on small screens. We welcome visitors of all languages ​​and scripts to visit and communicate. The browser's one-click translation function can largely eliminate language barriers.
